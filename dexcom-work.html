            <h2>A New CGM</h2>
            <p>In the winter of 2019 WWU's Senior ID studio partnered with Dexcom to imagine the future of their continuous glucose monitoring product line. Over 10 weeks our studio conducted user research, and passed through multiple concept stages to deliver a family of products designed to work together to fit seamlessly into a user's life.</p>
